# a manifesto

The initial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060323214134/https://www.frecklegirl.com/blog/2005/04/12/knitters-help/">spark</a> that lit Ravelry was the idea that our community needed an index, a database, to tie together all of the projects and patterns that people have shared and  spread across the internet and social media.  

Ravelry was developed with this idea at its core.  We work hard to be responsible stewards of the community's data and we walk a  line between limiting contamination from commerce/money  and trying to help small designers and yarnies be successful.  We are filling a void but we aren't the end of the story. 

:no_entry_sign::moneybag: It's just a start. It's not enough. The community needs an independent, not for-profit, **decentralized, community owned** directory of patterns, yarns, and their connections to projects.   Rav should be just one of *many* interfaces to this database and one of *many* ways of searching patterns and yarns, creating projects and stash that are linked to this database, and so on. The data that forms the heart of Ravelry was contributed by everyone and it belongs to everyone.   We  need to build this and  *we can't do this alone*.


We've intentionally kept the company/team small and limited commercialization and the amount of money and resources that we consume. :sparkles: I'm proud that we've kept space for this community to own its own infrastructure, prioritize its own needs, and connect designers to makers without being exploited by an intermediary. 

The yarn community's digital history and future infrastructure should not be controlled by a for-profit entity.
